# Jupiter80Librarian
The Roland Jupiter-80 is a powerful synth. With great power comes great... complexity. Sounds can have up to 4 levels (Registrations, Live Sets, Tones and Partials) but these dependencies must be manually organized with little help from the built-in system. This makes it difficult to know if a dependency will break when deleting a sound, or if a sound already exists on an import. Also, it is easy to forget which sounds are stored in which backup / export files.

This tool is an attempt to make it easier to get an overview of sounds and their dependencies. The tool can open SVD files from the Jupiter-80 and the Jupiter-50.
